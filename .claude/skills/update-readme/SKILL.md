description: Update the README.md features section to reflect the current state of the app. Use after implementing new user-facing features.
---

Update the Features section of `/README.md`.

## README structure

The README follows this section order — do NOT reorder or remove sections:

1. `# Title` + badges (inline, single line) + description
2. `## Features` — user-facing value propositions
3. `## Requirements` — minimum platform/SDK versions
4. `## Build` — how to compile/run
5. `## Architecture` — high-level structure for contributors
6. `## License`

## Rules

- Features = **USPs only** (user-facing value propositions)
- Do NOT list bug fixes, refactors, or internal improvements
- Do NOT include version numbers — the README reflects the **current state** of the app
- Keep descriptions concise (one line each)
- Format: `- **Feature name** — short description`
- Badges stay inline on a single line (no line breaks between them)
- Do NOT modify sections outside Features unless asked

## Steps

1. Read the current `README.md`
2. Review recent changes to understand what new user-facing features were added
3. Add/update/remove feature entries to match the current app state
