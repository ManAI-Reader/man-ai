description: Update the README.md features section to reflect the current state of the app. Use after implementing new user-facing features.
---

Update the Features section of `/README.md`.

## Rules

- Features = **USPs only** (user-facing value propositions)
- Do NOT list bug fixes, refactors, or internal improvements
- Do NOT include version numbers — the README reflects the **current state** of the app
- Keep descriptions concise (one line each)
- Format: `- **Feature name** — short description`

## Steps

1. Read the current `README.md`
2. Review recent changes to understand what new user-facing features were added
3. Add/update/remove feature entries to match the current app state
4. Do NOT modify anything outside the Features section unless asked
